4. Run the script by executing the `pdf_encryption.py` file:


## Usage

1. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the name of the PDF file you want to encrypt.
2. Next, you will be asked to provide a name for the encrypted PDF file.
3. Finally, enter a password for the PDF file. This password will be required to open and view the encrypted PDF.

## Note

- Ensure that the PDF file you want to encrypt and the script `pdf_encryption.py` are located in the same directory.
- The encrypted PDF file will be saved with the provided name and the extension ".pdf" added automatically.
